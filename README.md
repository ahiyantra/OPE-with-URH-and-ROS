## Object Pose Estimation With Unity Engine And Robot Operating System

A simulation demonstrating an object pose estimation algorithm through a robotic arm model with the unity engine's robotics integration packages and the robot operating system framework. Created to practice simulation skills with unity robotics hub. The usage example is available as an upload on youtube (https://youtu.be/fsrkcRMIClE).
