## Object Pose Estimation With Unity Engine And Robot Operating System

A computer simulation demonstrating an object pose estimation algorithm through a robotic arm model with the unity engine's robotics integration packages and the robot operating system framework. Created to practice robotic simulation skills with unity robotics hub. The development log is available as an upload on youtube (https://youtu.be/fsrkcRMIClE).
