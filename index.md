# OPE-with-URH-and-ROS

## Object Pose Estimation With Unity Engine And Robot Operating System

A computer simulation demonstrating the implementation of an object pose estimation algorithm from unity computer vision through a robotic arm model with the unity engine's robotics integration packages and the robot operating system (ROS) framework. Created in order to practice robotic simulation skills with unity robotics hub. YouTube upload link - https://youtu.be/fsrkcRMIClE
